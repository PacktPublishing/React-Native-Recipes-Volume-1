## About the Video Course
React has taken the web development world by storm, and it is only natural that its unique architecture and third-party support ecosystem should be applied to native application development. Using JavaScript, you can build a truly native application that renders native UI components and accesses native device functionality. This video will take you from the basics of React Native development all the way through to some more advanced components.
This video course covers React Native topics ranging from adding basic UI components to successfully implementing Redux. The video follows a top-down approach, beginning with building rich user interfaces. These UIs will be created with both built-in and custom components. You will then animate UIs to make the application feel more alive. Then you will learn to store data in a native database and integrate it with the Facebook SDK. Finally, you will learn to make Redux fit into your application.
